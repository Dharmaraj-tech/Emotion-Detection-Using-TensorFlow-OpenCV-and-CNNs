ðŸš€ Excited to share my internship project at St Software Solutions! ðŸŽ‰  

During my internship, I had the opportunity to work on a real-time facial emotion detection system using "TensorFlow, OpenCV, and CNNs". This project involved training a deep learning model to recognize emotions like happiness, sadness, anger, and more from facial expressions. I then integrated it into a "Flutter app" to enable real-time emotion recognition.  

Key Highlights:  
âœ… Trained a CNN model on a large dataset for emotion classification  
âœ… Optimized real-time detection using OpenCV  
âœ… Integrated the trained model into a Flutter application  
âœ… Improved performance and accuracy for better user experience  

This hands-on experience enhanced my "skills in deep learning, computer vision, and mobile app development". Excited to continue exploring the possibilities of AI in real-world applications!  

STEPS TO IMPLEMENTATION
First download an data set for trainning process
LINK https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013
Then import it to the project folder
Copy this both files to your folder 
Import the required packages { TensorFlow, OpenCV, and CNNs }
Then run the trainemotion.py file
It will takes some time depends on your system configuration then it will create an new module based on your dataset 
Then run the testemotion.py file to access the module and shows the result of your face .
